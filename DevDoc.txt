Steps to deploy the contract:
1. Clone the ENS repository from https://github.com/rndfactory/ens.git. And cd into ens.
2. change branch using "git checkout phaethon"
3. Open it in your terminal
4. Install the dependencies using "yarn"
5. Create a ".env" file in the root of this repository
    5.1. the ".env" will have these parameters- 
            MNEMONIC=<add you account MNEMONIC without quotes>
            INFURA_API_KEY=<add your infura key without quotes>
    5.2 The .env will look something like this:
            MNEMONIC=asset major tag congress unaware amateur shrug design bitter cry noodle during
            INFURA_API_KEY=8d23123612f3412313ed08864be4ada01d8b450a0abc
6. To deploy the contract with "astro" as root:
    5.1 in your root terminal "yarn deploy-kovan"
    5.2 Wait for the script to run, it will take around 5 minutes to deploy on kovan


When you deploy the ENS contract, a root node is create, with bytes32 as following.
Root node:      0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

A FIFSRegistar is also deployed, the address of this contract is used a owner of the Astro Label. Bytes32 of astro label
Astro label:    0xa10290a6e2c6e6236ad7ba28af5965446a0a2cba270637c5ebd145c1b80b7d63

The astro label is converted into astro subnode. The new root bytes32: sha3(bytes32(root) + bytes32(label)).
Astro subnode:  0x2721599961c4258cb18fdce29de18a113fc33a70d00940b0ac17efb44a41c351

A subnode can be added by calling the "setSubnodeOwner" or "setSubnodeRecord". The later set the owner plus add resolver and ttl as one call.
